a procedurally-generated-game engine

## Purpose

Seeks to answer the question: 
> Can you tell a cohesive, compelling narrative using a procedurally generated story, providing gameplay within that narrative?

Using NLP techniques, a storyline should be able to be sequenced, randomly generated but cohesive (think AI generated news articles).

More difficult is providing art and gameplay for such a randomly generated narrative.

**Hypothesis:** Using public domain images on the web, keywords can be converted to art assets. Furthermore, via [style transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Style_Transfer), these disparate, randomly selected assets can be normalized to a consistent art style, providing recognizable scenes, prcocedurally generated.

The biggest roadblock is likely to be gameplay. How unconstrained can gameplay be? Can it be as random as the narrative?
